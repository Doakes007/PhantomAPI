# PhantomAPI — AI-Driven API Anomaly Detection & Auto-Healing Gateway

Problem:
Traditional API gateways only route requests. They do NOT detect anomalies, predict failures, or auto-heal.
PhantomAPI introduces AI-based anomaly detection + self-healing to secure and stabilize API infrastructure.

Day 1 Progress:
- Defined problem statement
- Designed High Level Architecture
- Bootstrapped proxy gateway
- Initialized Git repo
